## Building a User Interface

Building a UI is comprised of three parts:

1. Instantiating input and output widgets
2. Frameworks and layouts
3. Organizing widgets within the framework

## Widgets

- Go to `projects/project1-ui` and take a look at `UI_starting.R` and `Knight_bus.R`.

- Run `app.R`.

- **Widgets** are the different buttons and fields we see on a webpage. 

- We only see the inputs from `UI_starting.R` because nothing is connected to the outputs.

## The Shiny Widget Gallery

### Input Widgets

- You can try out and play with Shiny input widgets on RStudio's website.

- The website shows you how the values change when you modify the input widgets. The site will also show you the code you need to include the widget in your own app.

## Output Widgets

- Output widgets are similar to input widgets. However, output widgets require a `render` function to be visible in the app.

- Each output widget has its own corresponding `render` function.

## Playing with Widgets

Add some input widgets to `UI_starting.R`

- actionLink

- checkboxInput

- radioButtons

- textInput

Make sure the app still works with your changes!

## Connecting Inputs to Outputs

Add some reactive logic to `Knight_bus.R` so that the text output `felix` (`output$felix`) displays the selected choice from `annie` (`input$annie`)

## Frameworks and Layouts

- Replace `UI_starting.R` with `UI_fluid_page.R` in the `app.R`.

- Run the app

- Pretty ugly, right? Now try replacing `tagList` with `fluidPage`

## `fluidPage()`

A fluid page layout consists of rows which in turn contain columns

- Rows ensure that items appear on the same line as long as the browser is wide enough (hence the fluid)

- Columns define how much horizontal space elements should occupy. Horizontal space is defined by a 12-unit wide grid

- Adds some Bootstrap styling (framework for designing websites--developed by Twitter)

## `fluidRow()` and `column()`


Changing `tagList` to `fluidPage` didn't do much

Let's add some `fluidRows()` and `column()` functions to create this:

The solution is in `UI_language_soln.R`

## `fluidPage()` is responsive

- Try adjusting the size of your browser window.

- The text adjusts so that it all fits within a single window--no need to scroll left and right!

## Other Layouts

Check out the Shiny cheatsheet to see other types of layouts

- `tabsetPanel()` + `tabPanel()`

- `sidebarLayout()` + `sidebarPanel()`/`mainPanel()`

- `splitLayout()`

- `wellPanel()`

- `navbarPage()`

- `navlistPanel()`
