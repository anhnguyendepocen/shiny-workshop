## Building a User Interface

1. Instantiating input and output widgets
2. Frameworks and layouts
3. Organizing widgets within the framework

## Widgets

- Open `project1-ui` and take a look at `UI_starting.R` and `Knight_bus.R`.

- Run `app.R`.

- We only see inputs because nothing is connected to the outputs.

## The Shiny Widget Gallery

### Input Widgets

## Output Widgets

## Playing with Widgets

Add some input widgets to `UI_starting.R`

- actionLink

- checkboxInput

- radioButtons

- textInput

Make sure the app still works with your changes!

## Connecting Inputs to Outputs

Add some reactive logic to `Knight_bus.R` so that the text output `felix` (`output$felix`) displays the selected choice from `annie` (`input$annie`)

## Frameworks and Layouts

- Replace `UI_starting.R` with `UI_fluid_page.R`

- Run the app

- Pretty ugly, right? Now try replacing `tagList` with `fluidPage`

## `fluidPage()`

A fluid page layout consists of rows which in turn contain columns

- Rows ensure that items appear on the same line as long as the browser is wide enough (hence the fluid)

- Columns define how much horizontal space elements should occupy. Horizontal space is defined by a 12-unit wide grid

- Adds some Bootstrap styling (framework for designing websites--developed by Twitter)

## `fluidRow()` and `column()`


Changing `tagList` to `fluidPage` didn't do much

Let's add some `fluidRows()` and `column()` functions to create this:

## `fluidPage()` is responsive

Try adjusting the size of your browser window

## Other Layouts

- `tabsetPanel()` + `tabPanel()`

- `sidebarLayout()` + `sidebarPanel()`/`mainPanel()`

- `splitLayout()`

- `wellPanel()`

- `navbarPage()`

- `navlistPanel()`
