## Shiny apps are just webpages

Webpages are made up of 2 main components

1. **HTML/CSS**: what your app looks like (the **form**)
2. **JavaScript**: what your app does (the **function**)

<br>

The difference between Shiny apps and regular webpages:
Shiny apps are powered by an R session

## Creating a Shiny app

1. Regular R stuff: writing code to manipulate and analyze data, visualize with graphs, etc...

<br>

2. Create a user interface

3. Connect **1** to **2** with **reactive logic**

## Shiny Bridges Two Worlds of R Programming

| 1. **Muggle World**        | 2. **Wizarding World**    |
|         ---                |           ---             |
| - Regular R code           | - Reactives               |
| - Functions, packages, etc | - Functions w/o arguments |
|                            | - Values that can't be changed with **`<-`** |
|                            | - Packaged in a `server` function |

The Wizarding world can reach out to the Muggle world, but not the other way around.
