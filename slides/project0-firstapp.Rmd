## The main file, **`app.R`**

This file contains all the components of the app: the user interface and reactive logic.

The UI and reactive logic can be in separate files that are sourced in `app.R` or all put in the same file.

## `shinyApp()`

`app.R` is just a regular R script

- Adding the call to `shinyApp()` at the end of the script changes the "Run" button to "Run App"

## Starting in the Muggle World

Let's start with `muggle.R` (our run-of-the-mill R code)

- We load the libraries we need

- We create a function `muggle_plot` that takes variable names from the `diamonds` dataset as inputs and generates a scatterplot

- Test it out if you want

## User Interface

The function `tagList` takes HTML functions as inputs and creates a list of HTML components

- Try running the first line, `h2("A very basic Shiny app")` in the console

- Functions like `h2`, `p`, and `actionButton` are wrappers for HTML code (essentially strings)

- The first argument in `actionButton`, `plotOutput`, and `textOutput` are IDs. We will use these IDs in the next part


## Reactive Logic

We will connect the UI to the Muggle code with **reactive logic**

- We are assigning a function to `reactive_logic` with three arguments: `input`, `output`, and `session`. The arguments are always the same, but `reactive_logic` is usually called `server`.

- Functions `renderPlot` and `renderText` are assigned to `output$IDname`. They correspond to the UI functions `plotOutput` and `textOutput`

- Try running `renderText("Hello World!")`

## Invoking the App

`shinyApp(user_interface, reactive_logic)`

## Your Turn: Modify the App

1. Hide the button message until the button has been clicked 3 times.

2. Add `selectInput` dropdown menus for the X and Y variables.

3. (Superstar) Connect the `selectInput` menus to the plot (we haven't covered this yet)

## Deploying the App

1. Put all the files your app needs in a single directory (the name of the directory will be the name of the app)

2. Make sure there is a file called `app.R` with the call to `shinyApp()`

3. `rsconnect::deployApp("/path/to/app/directory")`
