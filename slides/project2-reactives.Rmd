## Reactivity

We've already seen some examples with our `render` functions, but what exactly is **reactivity**?


## More Harry Potter Comparisons

Remember, the Knight Bus is our connection between regular R code (Muggle World) and the world of reactives (Wizarding World)

`knight_bus <- function(input, output, session) {`
    reactive code here!
`}`


## Reactives: An Example

```
server <- function(input, output) {
    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        hist(rnorm(input$obs))
    })
}
```

In this example, input\$obs is a reactive source, and output\$distPlot is a reactive endpoint.

- Clicking or typing into input widgets will set some sort of value, or **reactive source**.

- A **reactive endpoint** is an object that appears in the app, like a plot, text, or values. Reactive endpoints re-execute when their reactive inputs change.


## 3 Types of KB Passengers

| inputs | conductors | observers |
|  ---   |    ---     |    ---    |
| ![](./images/input.png) | ![](./images/conductor.png) | ![](./images/observer.png) |
| `actionButton()` | `reactive()` | `observe()` |
| `selectInput()`  | `eventReactive()` | `observeEvent()` |
| `reactiveValues()`            | `renderText()` | `textOutput()` |

- Inputs are reactive sources. Reactive endpoints are called observers because they observe changes to inputs.

- Conductors act like both sources and endpoints. They depend on inputs, but they also provide inputs to other reactives.

## Reactives have connections

* Inputs have outward connections
* Observers have inward connections
* Conductors have both inward and outward connections

## Reactive States

***Reactives have 2 kinds of states***

1. **Their value**, e.g. numerical/text value, plot, image
2. **Their validity**--validated, invalidated

- Reactives are invalidated when their inputs change value. They become valid again when they recalculate or re-execute based on their input's new value.

## Project 2: Pythagorean Theorem

This script calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle using 
```
output$C <- renderText({
    sqrt(input$A^2 + input$B^2)
  })
```

- Run `pythagorean-1.R` and change the input values a few times.

- Stop the app

- Run `reactlogShow()` in the console (may need to install first)

A log will open in your browser

## reactlogShow()

- Click the forward arrow in the log window

- When input\$A or input\$B's value changed, it became invalidated.

- This then invalidates output$C

- output$C becomes validated once it recalculates

## Adding an expression: modularizing reactions

This script still calculates the hypotenuse but splits the calculation into two parts

1. `C2 <- reactive(input$A^2 + input$B^2, label = "C2")`

2. `output$C <- renderText(sqrt(C2()))`

- Run `pythagorean-2.R` and change the input values.

- Stop the app

- Run `reactlogShow()`

- Reactives are lazy and only update when they need to

## Reactives vs. observers

**Reactives**: calculate or cache a value, meant to be used as a variable, has a result

**Observers**: for side effects--runs some code when a dependency changes, doesn't yield a result, isn't used as input for other expressions, not assigned to a variable (e.g., updating a menu based on a selection)
