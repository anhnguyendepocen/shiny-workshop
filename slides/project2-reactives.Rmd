## Reactivity

We've already seen some examples with our `render` functions, but what exactly is **reactivity**?

Reactivity is a 2-step process

1. **Reactive values** *notify* functions that use them when they become invalid

2. Objects created by **reactive functions** *respond*

## Project 2: Pythagorean Theorem

- Run `pythagorean-1.R` and change the input values a few times.

- Stop the app

- Run `reactlogShow()` (may need to install first)


## Adding an expression: modularizing reactions

- Run `pythagorean-2.R` and change the input values.

- Stop the app

- Run `reactlogShow()`

- Reactives are lazy and only update when they need to

## Reactives vs. observers

**Reactives**: calculate or cache a value, meant to be used as a variable, has a result

**Observers**: runs some code when a dependency changes, doesn't yield a result, isn't used as input for other expressions, not assigned to a variable
